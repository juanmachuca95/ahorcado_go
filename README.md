# ðŸ’€ (Ahorcado) Multiplayer - Golang

Server developed in go using gRPC for communications that allows you to play the hangman game in a multiplayer way.
For this process it is necessary to previously have an account in mongo.cloud with a database for the game loaded. You just need two collections users and game. You can build database follows struct in models user.go and game.go

 And set the credentials ```MONGODB_NAME``` and ```MONGODB_PASSWORD```

```zsh
docker run --env MONGODB_NAME=xxx --env MONGODB_PASSWORD=xxx -p 8080:8080 juanmachuca95/ahorcado:v1 -d
```

This is the game server, but the client for it is also developed.
You have three from CLI
* Join the currente game
* See ranking top players at moment
* Exit

A user will be created automatically with the flag ```-user=<youruser>``` . The rest is intuitive
